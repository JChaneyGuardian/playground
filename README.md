# playground
Different  "playing around" types of projects that I wanted to be able to start from the same basic configurations

## Installed libraries
```
typescript
gulp gulp-typescript
tslint
webpack
```

Use `npm install` to reload node-modules currently defined in package.json

A full build and packaging can be accomplished with `gulp` from the Terminal window.

If you have the Node http-server installed `npm install -g http-server`, you can
serve up the public folder by running `http-server` from a new terminal shell
and opening http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser
